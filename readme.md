This repo powers the [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) site hosted at [riebesell.science](https://riebesell.science).

The site is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-06-16-announcing-gatsby-v2-beta-launch) v2 and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com) v4. Feel free to reuse any part of the source code to create your own Gatsby site.

## Development

1. Clone the repo and open a command prompt inside it.
2. Run

```
yarn
```

3. Run
