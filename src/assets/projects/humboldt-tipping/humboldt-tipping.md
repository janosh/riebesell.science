## Mission

The Humboldt current with its upwelling system at the Pacific coast of South America is a highly productive ecosystem in which not only around 9 million tons of fish and other seafood are caught every year but is also a hotspot of marine biodiversity. The system is subject to significant changes due to climatic, ecosystem and anthropogenic fluctuations that occur at different time scales (seasonal, annual, decadal and centennial) in addition to the increasingly visible effects of climate change.

Based on a variety of modelling efforts and the knowledge of key actors, we will explore possible adaptation measures and derive recommendations on governance in order to reduce the risk of tipping point impacts on the regional economy and increase the resilience of Peru's coastal communities.

## Project

The proposed project assesses the risk of decreased marine ecosystem productivity as a turning point for the ecological, economic and social systems that are interconnected under the Humboldt Upwelling System (HUS). The system's climate-related productivity is highly variable and affects local livelihoods and global markets.

The project focuses on two marine systems; on the one hand the high seas pelagic system that supplies the Peruvian industrial anchovy fishery with attention to its regional and global impacts through exports to international markets. On the other hand there are the coastal (Independence Bay and Sechura Bay) and insular (Galapagos) systems where artisanal fisheries, aquaculture and ecotourism are key maritime activities for livelihood provision.

With a consortium of biogeochemists, fisheries ecologists, ocean and ecosystem modellers, economists, social scientists and local communities from both Germany and Peru, we will work to understand the relationships between ecological, social and economic dynamics in the HUS.
