## What is Aquacosm?

EU network of mesocosms facilities for research on marine and freshwater ecosystems open for global collaboration.

## Why is Aquacosm needed?

Rivers, lakes, estuaries and the open ocean are connected and itâ€™s becoming evident that ecosystem processes act on many scales, including global. Despite this, aquatic research is still divided in marine and freshwater sciences, with separate funding sources, and experimental science is often conducted at single sites without international coordination. To challenge these problems, the FvB-IGB-lead project AQUACOSM is funded by the first international call (EU H2020-INFRAIA) to coordinate research, develop common best practices and open both freshwater and marine large-scale research infrastructures (mesocosms) for international cross-discipline participation.

By experimentally enclosing large volumes (1-1000 m3) of natural water, in so-called mesocosms, we can measure the separate effects of multiple stressors on whole ecosystems over weeks to years. This is presently the most realistic method to test how future climate and pollution may impact aquatic ecosystems, and thereby to compare with predictions from long-time data series and models. All these approaches are then combined to get the understanding necessary to mange our future water effectively. However, as the effects of different stressors may vary widely among ecosystems and seasons etc., they need to be investigated in comparable mesocosm experiments in different areas and with best possible methods. As these challenges have not been solved, the AQUACOSM project will fill a global void by forging an integrated freshwater and marine research infrastructure network.

## Objective

Strengthen EU network of mesocosm facilities and promote joint research initiatives, capacity building and standardization.

Extensive Transnational Access to at least 37 different sites or installations at 18 selected leading and highly complementary European mesocosm facilities

Geographic range from the Arctic to the Mediterranean. Unique infrastructures in catchments from mountains to lowlands; rivers, ponds, lakes, estuaries and the sea.
